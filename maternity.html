                 <h3>Working with Perinatal and Postpartum (PPD, Maternity Blues, Postpartum depression and anxiety)</h3>

                 <p style="text-align: left;">
                 Prenatal and Postpartum Support

                 If you feel you are struggling while pregnant, this can be an expression of mental illness or can be just normal 
                 and being heard can help. It can just be a frightening and emotional process. It is perfectly natural and 
                 acceptable to need a little support, and I am here to support you. You are not alone in this even if you feel 
                 like you have been or are.<br/>

                 <br/>Perhaps you have had your baby, and are not feeling happy the way you think you should. As an expert in 
                 perinatal and postpartum mental conditions and trauma, I can help you figure out if it is merely the stress 
                 typical of being a new parent, or if it is something more serious such as hormone-triggered depression, anxiety, 
                 or OCD that needs more substantial intervention.<br/>

                 <br/>If things were smooth through your pregnancy but your birth did not go as planned, or was outright traumatizing, 
                 there are things we can do to ease symptoms. Let me be your partner in finding your way, supporting and guiding 
                 you.<br/>

                 <br/>Pregnancy and birth trauma can be very hard on fathers as well. If it is impacting your relationship, or one 
                 of you is expressing symptoms of trauma such as anxious behavior, hypervigilance, flashbacks, discomfort towards 
                 doctors or hospitals, or you are just holding a lot or feel upset with what was supposed to be a beautiful 
                 experience, let me help you process your experiences.<br/>

                 <br/>If you donâ€™t have the support of someone who can take your baby so you can attend therapy, I will work with 
                 you, possibly even seeing you with your baby present.
