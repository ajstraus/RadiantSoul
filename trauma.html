                    <p>
                        Feel trapped in overdrive – on edge, irritable, ready to snap?<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Do you experience poor concentration or confusion, or feel easily overwhelmed?<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Do you suffer from trauma related scars, nightmares, or flashbacks?<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Do you avoid situations or reminders of the traumatic event?<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Are you suffering from post traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, or depression?<br/>
                        <br/>
                        You should know you are not alone.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        A study published in the Journal of Traumatic Stress revealed that post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) 
                        is perhaps more common than you think. Just over eight percent of people in our community will experience 
                        PTSD in their lifetimes, 4.7% within the past year, and 3.8% in the past six month period. When we include 
                        those who also suffer following significant trauma but don’t fit typical PTSD criteria, the statistics 
                        become as worrying as they are staggering.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        This means that millions of Americans continue to suffer from the devastating after effects of traumatic 
                        experience.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Trauma can alter how the brain functions, and its signs and symptoms can vary from finding it difficult to 
                        trust and being constantly on guard, to sudden panic and intrusive, anxiety-ridden thoughts. Trauma, 
                        without question, can significantly lessen your quality of life.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        And while the signs and symptoms can feel complex and at times overwhelming, feeling better is more 
                        than possible. In fact, with trauma therapy we expect you will begin feeling better as we implement our 
                        compassionate and client-focused evidence-based techniques and strategies together.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        We’ve helped countless people to gain positive ground over their traumatic experiences in our safe, 
                        supportive environment. We offer a variety of therapeutic approaches to best support you and work with 
                        you as an equal collaborator in your treatment and healing.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        So if these sound like you…

                        <ul style="line-height: 2; font-style: italic;">
                            <li>I struggle with anxiety or depression</li>
                            <li>I relive traumatic events with accompanying unwanted memories, vivid images, and physical signs 
                                like sweating, palpitations, and panic attacks</li>
                            <li>I am hyper vigilant or easily frightened</li>
                            <li>I feel edgy or irritable often</li>
                            <li>I feel like the joy, love, and other positive emotions have been sucked from my life</li>
                            <li>I’d like professional help to better understand and cope with previous trauma</li>
                            <li>I want to live an easier, happier, more connected life</li>
                        </ul>

                        …Then trauma therapy may offer the ideal therapeutic approach for you.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Trauma therapy combines different approaches and techniques to help lessen, even eliminate, the painful 
                        mental and physical responses raised by the memory of traumatic events, and seeks to create new healthier 
                        patterns in your brain.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        In trauma therapy I work with you as a team toward lessening, even extinguishing, the pain. It’s our 
                        goal to identify the source and triggers for your emotional and physical suffering, to discuss ways to 
                        deal with unhelpful and unhealthy thoughts and behaviors, and to teach you techniques to manage distress 
                        and enable you to move forward. If you would like me to show you how to take your next steps down the 
                        road of recovery, please contact me today for an appointment.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Sometimes in combination with trauma sometimes on its own grief can feel confusing or lonely.<br/>
                        Are you feeling profound sadness after the death of a loved one?<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Experiencing excessive guilt about something left unsaid or undone?<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Maybe you’re gripped with fear? Caught in a cycle of anxiety, helplessness, or panic?<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Or having trouble resuming a normal life with grief and pain as your constant companions?<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Maybe you’d like professional support through a period of mourning?<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Grief is a natural human response to loss, but that doesn’t mean bereavement of a loved one isn’t an 
                        intense and at times desolate experience. While painful experiences are normal during this time, your 
                        emotions may feel trapped on a non-stop rollercoaster, with downs and deeper downs interspersed with 
                        periods of brief respite.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Loss is a very personal journey, with some finding it more difficult than others. While grieving for 
                        the same person can often foster compassion and connection among family and friends, it’s also common 
                        for the grieving to struggle with anger, conflict, a lack of understanding, or an inability to fully 
                        share your feelings with others. Grief and bereavement counseling offers a non judgmental, safe space 
                        for you to work through any issues you are unable to with others. Grief and bereavement counseling can 
                        provide you a much-needed safe space to work through your struggles with a caring, nonjudgmental 
                        professional.
