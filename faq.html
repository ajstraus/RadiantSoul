                    <b>I’ve never talked to anyone. I’m used to handling things on my own. </b>

                    <b>Aren’t people who go to therapy weak?</b><br/>
                    <br/>
                    Not at all. People who ask for help know when they need it and have the ability to reach out. Everyone 
                    needs help now and then.You already have some strengths that you’ve used before, and for whatever reason, 
                    they aren’t working right now.  Perhaps this problem feels overwhelming and is making it difficult to access 
                    your past strengths. In our work together, I’ll help you identify what those strengths are and how to 
                    implement them again in what is happening now.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    <b>What’s the difference between talking to you or my best friend or family?</b><br/>
                    <br/>
                    The difference is between someone who can do something, and someone who has the training and experience to do 
                    that same thing professionally. A mental health professional can help you approach your situation in a new 
                    way– teach you new skills, gain different perspectives, listen to you without judgment or expectations, and 
                    help you listen to yourself. Furthermore, therapy is completely confidential. You won’t have to worry about 
                    others “knowing my business.” Lastly, if your situation provokes a great deal of negative emotion, if you’ve 
                    been confiding in a friend or family member, there is the risk that once you are feeling better you could 
                    start avoiding that person so you aren’t reminded of this difficult time in your life.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    <b>Why shouldn’t I just take medication?</b><br/>
                    <br/>
                    Medication alone cannot solve all issues. What medication does is treat the symptoms. Our work together is 
                    designed to explore the root of the issue, dig deep into your behavior and teach strategies that can help 
                    you accomplish your personal and/or relational goals.
                    Medication can be effective and is sometimes needed in conjunction with therapy.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    <b>How does it work? What do I have to do in sessions?</b><br/>
                    <br/>
                    Because each person has different issues and goals for therapy, therapy will be different depending on 
                    the individual. I tailor my therapeutic approach to your specific needs.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    <b>How long will it take?</b><br/>
                    <br/>
                    Unfortunately, this is not possible to say in a general FAQs page. Everyone’s circumstances are unique to 
                    them and the length of time therapy can take to allow you to accomplish your goals depends on your desire 
                    for personal development, your commitment, and the factors that are driving you to seek therapy in the first 
                    place.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    <b>I want to get the most out of therapy. What can I do to help?</b><br/>
                    <br/>
                    I am so glad you are dedicated to getting the most out of your sessions. Your active participation and 
                    dedication is crucial to your success. After all, we only see each other for a session a week. It’s the 
                    work you do outside of our sessions that will really help you see your personal growth and development.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    <b>My partner and I are having problems. Should we be in individual counseling or come together?</b><br/>
                    <br/>
                    If you are concerned about your relationship, and you would both like to work with me, I would initially 
                    work with both of you together. After this work, if one of you would like to continue in individual sessions, 
                    I could work with only one of you. It is not helpful to move from individual into couple’s work with the 
                    same therapist because of potential trust issues.<br/>
