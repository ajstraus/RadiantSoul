                     <br/>I work with social justice and understanding no matter the cultural and religious background the 
                     client is part of. I am very interested in my client’s perspective and how they are being affected by their 
                     environment. Where possible a goal would be to change toxic or unhealthy things in the environment. This 
                     is not always possible so understanding and work with Cognitive Behavioral Technique can help. Also having 
                     someone just want to listen and understand can help. I am here for that. I do have specialized competency 
                     for working with fundamentalist Christian backgrounds such as Jehovah’s Witnesses (active and inactive). I 
                     am open to others spirituality/ religion and how it impacts them. I like to work with that background to 
                     build resources.

                                   I am open to seeing any couple or family. I have a special understanding in working with Interfaith 
                                   and Step or Blended Families. I have experience working with difference in backgrounds and helping 
                                   partners see those differences and work with them in a positive manner. I have training in EFT 
                                   with focus on trauma in couples and AEDP as it applies with couples. I am good at tracking people 
                                   and holding for them and this plays out well with couples and families.<br/>
                                   
                                   Our work will involve searching out with your relationship the mysteries of what each individual 
                                   brings and then helping each side receive the positive that their partner brings to the 
                                   relationship. Then with families using patterns and communication to build a new system that 
                                   everyone has a hand in. Some of the things I work with couples to do is:

                                Love working with all ages. When I am working with children it can be a mix of working with parents 
                                if the child is very young that includes how child and parent are attaching and relating to each other 
                                and then how child is eventually working with his or her independence. When working with ages 6-11 
                                we will often do play therapy including movement, games and sand tray work. While doing these things 
                                we get get to know child and get to know how he/she interacts with his/her environment. Often we do a 
                                few sessions and then include mom and dad to hear their concerns and help them relate to the child and 
                                what is bring them to therapy. <br/>
                                Then in working with ages 12-19. This will often look more like adult 
                                therapy. It is more about where the client thinks they are. This like with 18+ clients will be working 
                                through talk therapy or if they are open to it bring in gentle spirituality through movement and other 
                                modalities. <br/>
                                In adult stages we work with transitions of college and stress that occurs in daily life. 
                                Then of the life changes that come with relationships and later, planning marriage and planning 
                                baby/ having one. Often in these times people discover attachment problems and patterns that are not 
                                working for them or fear to work through. This is what we work together on. I consider myself more of a 
                                guide that works with the skills you have developed, to help you have better communication thus being 
                                more comfortable in life as you move through these transitions. <br/>
                                55+ may be working with talk therapy 
                                like younger people or they may work with grief, loss or life transition through movement, mindfulness 
                                through meditation. No matter your age I like working with no shame and turning off that ingrained voice. 
                                One way I may do this is using Ho’oponopono.
