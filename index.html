             A BIT ABOUT THERAPY<br/>

             <br/><i>"Guiding You On the Path of Self-Healing"</i><br/>

             <br/>According to the American Psychological Association, “Psychologists (Psychotherapists) help people of all ages live 
             happier, healthier and more productive lives.” Through the use of various psychotherapy methods and collaborative treatment 
             measures, my patients develop life-changing habits to help them cope with any of life’s various obstacles. My therapy 
             sessions are designed to dissect personal issues and provide patients with effective tools to help them see the glass half 
             full instead of half empty.</p>
